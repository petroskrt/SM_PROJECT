            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight which can burn leaves. Can tolerate moderate shade but may develop smaller leaves with fewer fenestrations. East or north-facing windows are ideal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Water when top 2-3 inches of soil feels dry. Maintain consistent moisture but avoid waterlogging. Reduce watering in winter. Use room temperature water and ensure good drainage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Ideal temperatures between 65-85째F (18-29째C). Maintain humidity above 60%. Use a humidifier or pebble tray if needed. Protect from cold drafts and temperatures below 60째F (15째C).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Soil & Pot</h3>
                <p>Well-draining, rich potting mix. Add orchid bark and perlite for better aeration. Use pots with drainage holes. Consider a moss pole or trellis for support as the plant matures.</p>
