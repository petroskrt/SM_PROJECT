            <h2>About Fiddle Leaf Figs</h2>
            <p>Fiddle Leaf Figs are popular indoor trees known for their large, violin-shaped leaves and impressive height.

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Bright, indirect light is essential. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but protect from harsh afternoon rays. Rotate plant quarterly to ensure even growth. Consistent light is key - they don't adapt well to changes in lighting conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Water thoroughly when top 1-2 inches of soil feels dry. Ensure pot has good drainage and empty saucer after watering. Water less in winter. Consistency is crucial - irregular watering can cause leaf drop. Use room temperature water and avoid wetting the leaves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Prefers humidity around 40-60%. Use a humidifier or pebble tray if needed. Maintain temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C). Avoid cold drafts, air conditioning vents, and heating units - they're very sensitive to temperature fluctuations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Soil & Fertilizer</h3>
                <p>Well-draining, rich potting mix. Add perlite for better drainage. Fertilize with balanced, water-soluble fertilizer monthly during growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop fertilizing in winter.</p>
