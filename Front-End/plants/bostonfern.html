            <h2>About Boston Fern</h2>
            <p>Boston Ferns are classic houseplants known for their graceful, arching fronds with small, delicate leaflets. Originally from tropical regions, they've been popular indoor plants since the Victorian era. These plants can grow quite large and make excellent hanging basket specimens.</p>

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Bright, indirect light is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the fronds. Can tolerate lower light conditions but growth may be slower. Morning sun is fine, but protect from harsh afternoon rays.</p>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Requires consistent moisture - never let the soil dry out completely. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. High humidity is crucial (50-80%). Use a humidity tray, regular misting, or a humidifier. Avoid letting water sit on the fronds.</p>
