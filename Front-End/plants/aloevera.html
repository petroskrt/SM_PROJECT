            <h2>About Aloe Vera</h2>
            <p>Aloe Vera, is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe.[4] It is widely distributed, and is considered an invasive species in many world regions. An evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but also grows wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated for commercial products, mainly as a topical treatment used over centuries. The species is considered attractive for decorative purposes, and is often used indoors as a potted plant.</p>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Thrives in bright, indirect sunlight. Can tolerate some direct sun, but too much intense afternoon sun may cause leaves to turn brown. Ideal location is near a south or west-facing window.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Water deeply but infrequently - allow soil to dry completely between waterings (usually every 2-3 weeks). Water even less during winter. Signs of overwatering include soft, mushy leaves and root rot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Humidity & Temperature</h3>

            <h2>Harvesting & Use Tips</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p>When harvesting aloe gel:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose mature leaves from the outer portion of the plant</li>
                    <li>Cut leaves at the base, as close to the stem as possible</li>
                    <li>Allow the yellow sap (aloin) to drain before collecting the gel</li>
                    <li>Only harvest what you need - the gel doesn't store well long-term</li>
                    <li>Never harvest more than 1/3 of the plant's leaves at once</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p>While aloe vera gel is generally safe for topical use, the yellow sap (latex) found just under the skin can cause skin irritation in some people and should not be ingested. Keep away from pets as it can be toxic if eaten.</p>
