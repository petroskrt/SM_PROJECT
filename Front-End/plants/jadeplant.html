            <h2>About Jade Plants</h2>
            <p>Jade plants, also known as money plants or lucky plants, are succulent houseplants native to South Africa. Known for their thick, woody stems and oval-shaped leaves, they can grow into small trees over time. In many cultures, they're considered symbols of prosperity and good fortune.</p>

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Bright, indirect light with some direct morning sun. At least 4-6 hours of bright light daily. South or west-facing windows are ideal. Protect from intense afternoon sun. Leaves may develop red tinges in bright light - this is normal and healthy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Allow soil to dry completely between waterings. Water thoroughly but infrequently. Reduce watering in winter. Signs of thirst include slightly wrinkled leaves. Better to underwater than overwater - jade plants are drought-tolerant succulents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Ideal temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C). Can tolerate cooler temperatures but protect from frost. Prefer average to low humidity. Good air circulation is important.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Soil & Pot</h3>
                <p>Well-draining cactus or succulent mix. Add perlite or coarse sand for better drainage. Use pots with drainage holes. Terracotta pots are ideal as they help prevent overwatering by wicking away excess moisture.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Gently twist off a healthy leaf</li>
                    <li>Let it callus for 2-3 days</li>
                    <li>Place on top of well-draining soil</li>
                    <li>Mist occasionally until roots develop</li>
                </ul>
            </br>
                <p><b>Stem Cuttings</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cut a healthy stem 3-4 inches long</li>
                    <li>Remove lower leaves</li>
                    <li>Allow cut end to dry for several days</li>
                    <li>Plant in slightly moist, well-draining soil</li>
