            <h2>About Spider Plants</h2>
            <p>Chlorophytum comosum, usually called spider plant or common spider plant due to its spider-like look,is a species of evergreen perennial flowering plant of the family Asparagaceae. It is native to tropical and Southern Africa but has become naturalized in other parts of the world, including Western Australia and Bangladesh. It is easy to grow as a houseplant because of its resilience, but it can be sensitive to the fluoride in tap water, which commonly gives it "burnt tips".</p>

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>The Spider plant grows best in indirect light. While it can tolerate some direct sun in the morning, too much full sunlight will burn its leaves. Filtered light is the best option for this green beauty. Your plant should receive only 4 to 6 hours of bright light daily to prevent leaf issues. The best location for your Spider plant would be an east or west-facing window. Furthermore, it can also adapt to low light, but won't be as lush.</p>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Water the spider plant about once a week. Letting the soil dry out a little between waterings is a good idea. If you start to see fungus growing, yellowed leaves, or root rot occurring on your spider plant, you may be overwatering.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Prefers  60-80° F (15.5-24.6°C). Your Spider Plant will do well in normal household humidity but will thrive with a bit more humidity. Brown leaf tips may indicate the air is too dry, so mist your Spider Plant regularly using a Mister.</p>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Soil & Pot</h3>
                <p>well-draining potting mix. A mixture of houseplant soil, perlite, and vermiculite works well. You can also add a bit of sand for extra drainage.</p>
