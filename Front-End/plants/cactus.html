            <h2>About Cacti</h2>
            <p>Cacti are succulent plants native to the Americas, specifically adapted to survive in arid conditions. They come in a vast array of shapes and sizes, from tiny ball cacti to towering saguaros. Their unique ability to store water and specialized growth pattern make them fascinating and relatively low-maintenance houseplants.</p>

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Bright, direct sunlight for 4-6 hours daily is ideal. South or west-facing windows are perfect. New plants should be gradually acclimated to prevent sunburn. Most species need strong light to maintain their shape and promote flowering.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Water thoroughly but infrequently - allow soil to dry completely between waterings. General rule: water every 1-2 weeks during growing season (spring/summer) and monthly or less in winter. Always err on the side of underwatering rather than overwatering.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Temperature & Humidity</h3>
                <p>Prefer warm temperatures (70-80째F/21-27째C) during growing season. Can tolerate cooler temperatures in winter (50-55째F/10-13째C). Most cacti prefer low humidity and good air circulation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Soil & Drainage</h3>
                <p>Fast-draining cactus mix is essential. Mix regular potting soil with coarse sand, pumice, or perlite for better drainage. Always use pots with drainage holes. Consider top-dressing with gravel or small stones.</p>

            <h2>Common Problems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotting base or roots - Almost always indicates overwatering</li>
                <li>Wrinkled or shriveled appearance - Signs of underwatering</li>
                <li>Pale, yellow, or bleached appearance - Too much direct sun without acclimation</li>
                <li>Elongated, stretched growth - Insufficient light (etiolation)</li>
                <li>White, cottony patches - Mealybugs infestation</li>
                <li>Corking (brown, bark-like tissue at base) - Natural aging process, not harmful</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Seasonal Care</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p><b>Growing Season (Spring/Summer)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rotate the plant regularly to ensure even growth</li>
                    <li>Remove any dead or yellowing fronds at the base to maintain appearance</li>
                    <li>Clean fronds occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust</li>
                    <li>Repot every 2-3 years or when roots begin growing through drainage holes</li>
                    <li>Consider moving outdoors to a shaded location during warm months</li>
                    <li>Divide large plants in spring to create new specimens</li>
                </ul>
            </br>
                <p><b>Dormant Season (Fall/Winter)</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce watering significantly</li>
                    <li>Stop fertilizing</li>
                    <li>Maintain cooler temperatures</li>
                    <li>Continue providing bright light</li>

            <h2>Safety Note</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p>Always handle cacti with care - use thick gloves or folded newspaper when repotting or handling. Some species have very fine glochids (tiny barbed spines) that can be difficult to remove from skin. Keep out of reach of children and pets.</p>

            <h2>Propagation Tips</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p>Cacti can be propagated though:</p>
                <li>Offsets or "pups" - carefully remove and allow cut to callus before planting</li>
                <li>Stem cuttings - cut a segment, let it callus, then plant in dry soil</li>
                <li>Seeds - requires patience and specific conditions for germination</li>
