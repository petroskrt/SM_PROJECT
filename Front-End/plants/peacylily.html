            <p>Peace lilies are elegant indoor plants known for their dark green leaves and distinctive white flowers. They're popular houseplants due to their adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Despite their name, they're not true lilies but members of the Araceae family. </p>

            <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>Prefers medium to low indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as it can burn the leaves. Can tolerate fluorescent lights, making them perfect for offices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when top inch of soil feels dry. They dramatically droop when thirsty but recover quickly after watering. Prefer distilled or filtered water as they're sensitive to fluoride and chlorine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
                <h3>Humidity & Temperature</h3>
                <p>Enjoys high humidity (50% or higher). Mist regularly or use a humidity tray. Thrives in temperatures between 65-80°F (18-27°C). Keep away from cold drafts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <div class="care-tip">
                <p>The peace lily is mildly toxic to humans and other animals when ingested. Like many Araceae, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation, a burning sensation in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and nausea.</p>
